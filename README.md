# Strassen Winograd

This repository stores the implementation of Strassens' Matrix Multiplication 
with Morton ordering. 
The main implementation that I am currently working on is located in `w_strassen_morton.c`.  
The `previous_attempts` directory stores my previous attempts of creating an efficient 
Strassen MM algorithm. 

## Problem Statement
How can we create an efficient Matrix Multiplication subroutine that runs in sub O(N^3) time?
